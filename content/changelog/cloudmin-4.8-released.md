This update adds support for multiple network bridges for KVM systems, simpler alerting for systems going down, status history that includes the user or source of a change, purging of old date-based backups, the ability to select the configuration type for OpenVZ instances, and new API commands for fetching the details of a file, listing historic statistics about a system, and transferring whole directories between systems.
