This release includes image creation, backup and cloning optimizations when iSCSI is in use, better calculation of free disk space for new VMs and disks, an easier way to add KVM command line parameters, and many other small features and bugfixes. It also moves all background cron jobs to Webmin's built-in cron service, which reduces memory use and startup latency.
