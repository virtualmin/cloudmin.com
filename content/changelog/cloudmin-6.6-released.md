The major new feature in this version is support for iSCSI, which allows virtual system disks to be stored on a remote system separate from their hosts. This makes system moves faster, and reduces the amount of storage needed on host systems. Also in this release is improved Xen 4.2 support, and the ability to select systems to backup by host or location group.
