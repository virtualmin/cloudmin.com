### Community Support
For GPL users or those who prefer a community-based help, we encourage you to join and engage with our forum, where our staff and community members are always eager to help. Feel free to post your questions there if you're comfortable with a brief wait. Our community, along with the staff, actively participate and are keen to assist. While we prioritize direct support for paid customers, we value each user and strive to contribute to forum discussions as often as possible.

However, before engaging, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with our [guidelines](https://forum.virtualmin.com/guidelines) to ensure a positive and productive experience.

### Report a Bug

Help improve our products for everyone:

- Spotted a bug? Whether you're a GPL or Pro user, we encourage you to report it. Use the appropriate [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/virtualmin/) to report non-security related bugs.
- For sensitive reports, especially security vulnerabilities, please use the designated `security@` email address to ensure responsible handling of the issue.
- Our forum is also a place to discuss potential bugs; sometimes what seems like a bug might be a configuration issue that the community or our staff can quickly resolve.

Remember, your feedback and reports are invaluable. They not only help us improve our software but also enhance the experience for the entire user base. Let's work together to keep it running smoothly.
